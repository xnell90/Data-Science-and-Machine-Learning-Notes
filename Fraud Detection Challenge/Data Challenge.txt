===== Data Challenge =========


Company XYZ is an e-commerce site that sells hand-made clothes. You have to
build a model that predicts whether a user has a high probability of using the
site to perform some illegal activity or not. You only have information about
the user first transaction on the site and based on that you have to make your
classification ("fraud/no fraud").

These are the tasks you are asked to do:
- For each user, determine her country based on the numeric IP address.

- Build a model to predict whether an activity is fraudulent or not.
Explain how different assumptions about the cost of false positives
vs false negatives would impact the model.

- Your boss is a bit worried about using a model she doesn't understand for
something as important as fraud detection. How would you explain her how the
 model is making the predictions? Not from a mathematical perspective
(she couldn't care less about that), but from a user perspective. What kinds of
 users are more likely to be classified as at risk? What are their
 characteristics?Let's say you now have this model which can be used live to
 predict in real time if an activity is fraudulent or not.

From a product perspective, how would you use it? That is, what kind of
different user experiences would you build based on the model output?

Data:
"Fraud_Data" - information about each user first transaction

Columns:

user_id : ID of the user. Unique by user

signup_time : the time when the user created her account (GMT time)

purchase_time : the time when the user bought the item (GMT time)

purchase_value : the cost of the item purchased (USD)

device_id : the device id. You can assume that it is unique by device. I.e.,
transactions with the same device ID means that the same physical device was
used to buy

source : user marketing channel: ads, SEO, Direct (i.e. came to the site by
directly typing the site address on the browser).

browser : the browser used by the user.

sex : user sex: Male/Female

age : user age

ip_address : user numeric ip address

class : this is what we are trying to predict: whether the activity was
fraudulent (1) or not (0).

"IpAddress_to_Country" - mapping each numeric ip address to its country.
For each country, it gives a range. If the numeric ip address falls within
the range, then the ip address belongs to the corresponding country.

Columns:
lower_bound_ip_address : the lower bound of the numeric ip address for that
country

upper_bound_ip_address : the upper bound of the numeric ip address for that
country

country : the corresponding country. If a user has an ip address whose value is
within the upper and lower bound, then she is based in this country.
